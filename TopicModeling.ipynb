    "# Areas of Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few areas where I feel the classification can be improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We could have done more fine tuning in the cleaning of the documents. This could have allowed for more concise and more distinct topic labels. Additionally, we could have removed the entries where the 'text' field was blank.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Determining the number of topics seemed very rough and arbitrary. Perhaps there is a more formal way to get a more effective number of topics. I can see that deciding there are too many topics can lead to 'overfitting' for a lack of a better term, when the goal is to simply categorize.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Recall we picked the topic with the highest probability to label each document. This leaves plenty of room for error. If we fine-tuned the number of topics and number of words for each topic, we could probably get the probabilities to be much higher when labeling the documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I feel this was a decent starting point for filtering out which documents to hone in on. As a possible next step, I think it would be interesting to apply what I had done on the text of the articles to just the titles themselves, or perhaps including the title in the text (new column with text and title appended). Although the model can be improved, I believe it offers a solid platform for determining the more relevant articles that are of interest to Crunchbase."
